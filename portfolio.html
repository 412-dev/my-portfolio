<h3>Learning Journey</h3>
   <p><b>Day 1</b>: I went through the basics and learned what page structure looks like.</p>
   <p><b>Day 2</b>: I explored the head section of an HTML document. I learned how to use &lt;title&gt;, &lt;meta&gt;, and how the head helps define information about the page. </p>
   <p><b>Day 3</b>: I practiced working with text elements like headings, paragraphs, emphasis, strong, and other inline elements. I also learned about semantic tags like &lt;abbr&gt; and &lt;address&gt; .</p>
